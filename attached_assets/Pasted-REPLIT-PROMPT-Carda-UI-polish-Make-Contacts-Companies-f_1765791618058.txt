REPLIT PROMPT — Carda UI polish (Make Contacts/Companies feel “Apple”, remove list-y dashboard vibe)

You are working inside my existing Carda repo (React + TypeScript + Tailwind; keep existing logic/data unchanged). 
Goal: Make the Contacts → Companies experience feel modern, minimal, and “native-like” by doing ONLY these 3 changes:
1) Companies screen → replace list cards with a clean grid of company tiles.
2) Company detail header → simplify hierarchy (less boxed UI, clearer title area).
3) People filters → hide chips/buttons into a bottom sheet (Filter icon) so the screen isn’t cluttered.

CRITICAL RULES
- Do NOT break existing routes, state, storage, or data models.
- Do NOT remove features. You may relocate/hide controls behind menus/sheets.
- Do NOT change the bottom nav, Scan flow, Events Hub, or any other module.
- Keep the existing design tokens/colors; just improve layout and hierarchy.
- Must be fully responsive (mobile-first) and iOS-safe-area friendly.

========================================================
A) COMPANIES SCREEN: GRID TILES (replaces list-y rows)
========================================================
Find the Companies view under Contacts (the screen that currently shows company cards with “View Org Map” button).

1) Replace the vertical list of company cards with a TILE GRID:
- Mobile: 2 columns (gap ~12px).
- Tablet/Desktop: 3–4 columns (auto-fit).
- Keep the existing Search input and “Add Company” button at the top.
- Keep the “People | Companies” segmented control as-is.

2) Tile design (CompanyTile):
- Whole tile is tappable → navigates to Company detail page (same behavior as clicking a company today).
- Content (minimal):
  - Top-left: company monogram / building icon in a soft rounded square.
  - Company name (truncate to 1 line).
  - Under it: “X contacts” (subtle).
  - Under it: website domain (subtle, truncate).
- Remove “View Org Map” from each tile (no per-row CTA).
- Optional quick action (recommended): a small “⋯” icon in the top-right of the tile opens a tiny menu:
  - Open Company
  - Open Org
  - Add Note
  (Menu must not be required; tapping the tile must still work.)

3) Interactions:
- Hover (desktop): slight lift + subtle shadow transition.
- Mobile: active press state (slight scale or opacity) with smooth transition.
- Loading/empty states:
  - If no companies: show clean empty state with “Add Company” CTA.
  - Search empty: “No matching companies”.

Implementation notes:
- Create reusable components:
  - client/src/components/companies/CompanyTile.tsx
  - client/src/components/companies/CompanyGrid.tsx
- Update the Companies screen component to use CompanyGrid.
- Keep existing company data mapping; only change layout.

========================================================
B) COMPANY DETAIL: SIMPLIFY HEADER & HIERARCHY
========================================================
Find the Company detail page (shows Flow Power header card + tabs People/Org/Notes).

1) Replace the big boxed header card with a simpler “hero header”:
- Left: logo/monogram icon (same as tile).
- Right: company name (large), website domain (small), contact count (small).
- Reduce the “card inside a card” feel: use one clean surface, not multiple stacked boxes.

2) Tabs row:
- Keep People / Org / Notes tabs, but tighten spacing and make it feel like a single control.
- Ensure it stays readable and not cramped on iPhone width.

3) Primary actions:
- Any edit actions (Edit Org, Auto-group, etc.) must remain available BUT should not clutter the top.
- Put secondary actions behind:
  - a small toolbar row inside the active tab area, OR
  - a “⋯” menu in the header.
Pick the option that keeps the screen clean.

========================================================
C) PEOPLE FILTERS: MOVE CHIPS INTO A BOTTOM SHEET (CLEAN UI)
========================================================
Currently People view shows filter chips (All/Exec/Legal/Project Delivery…) plus buttons.

Change to:
1) Replace visible chips row with a compact controls row:
- Left: “Filter” button/icon (funnel) that opens a bottom sheet.
- Optionally show a tiny summary text like “All · Any influence” when filters are default.
- Right: Sort icon (optional) or keep current sort if any.

2) Bottom sheet content (FilterSheet):
- Must be mobile-friendly (bottom drawer / sheet).
- Sections:
  - Department/Role (multi-select): All, Exec, Legal, Project Delivery (and any existing ones).
  - Influence (single select): Any, High, Low (or existing influence options).
  - Clear filters button
  - Apply button
- On Apply, update the People list exactly as before (same filtering logic; you’re just relocating UI).

3) “Auto-group” and “Edit Org”:
- If those are on People view, keep them accessible but move them into a small “Actions” area:
  - Either inside the FilterSheet under an “Actions” section, OR
  - Behind a “⋯” menu next to Filter.
Do NOT remove functionality.

Implementation notes:
- Use existing UI primitives in the repo. If shadcn/ui Sheet or Drawer exists, use it.
- If not, implement a lightweight bottom-sheet component with:
  - portal overlay
  - slide-up animation
  - close on backdrop tap
  - close button
- Create:
  - client/src/components/filters/FilterSheet.tsx

========================================================
D) POLISH REQUIREMENTS (MUST DO)
========================================================
- Consistent spacing: reduce vertical stacking; use whitespace intentionally.
- Touch targets: minimum ~44px height for tappable controls.
- iOS safe area: ensure bottom sheet and pages don’t clash with the bottom nav; use safe-area-inset-bottom padding where needed.
- Truncation: company names and roles must not overflow.
- No layout jumps: keep heights stable where possible.

========================================================
E) ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (TEST THIS)
========================================================
1) Contacts → Companies shows a clean grid (2 columns on iPhone).
2) Tapping a tile opens company details correctly.
3) No “View Org Map” buttons on company tiles anymore.
4) Company detail header looks simplified and premium (less “card stack”).
5) People view looks clean: no chip row clutter; Filter opens bottom sheet.
6) Applying filters changes the People list correctly.
7) Auto-group and Edit Org are still reachable and working.
8) Nothing else in the app got visually/regression-broken.

Now implement these changes with minimal refactors:
- Prefer adding new components and swapping layout over rewriting core logic.
- Keep existing props, types, and storage behavior intact.
- After implementing, quickly scan for unused components/styles and remove dead code safely.

OUTPUT
- Make the code changes directly in the repo.
- If you add new components, wire them cleanly and keep naming consistent with the existing codebase.
